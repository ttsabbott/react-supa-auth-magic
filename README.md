# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This project was created to learn about supbase auth and magic link.

Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase. It provides a set of tools for building web and mobile applications. Magic is a passwordless authentication service that provides secure and user-friendly login experience.

Tech used: React, Supabase Auth, MagicLink
