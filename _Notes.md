# Misc notes
-   did not use semi-colons in this project, ugh that was tough habit to break!

## https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-react
-   npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
-   npm install @supabase/supabase-js
-   npm install @supabase/auth-ui-react @supabase/auth-ui-shared

## Combined both magic link signon and normal signon into the same App.jsx
-   magic link is first
-   supa auth is second
